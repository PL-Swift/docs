# PL/Swift Documentation

**PL/Swift** allows you to write custom SQL functions and types
for the
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database server
in the 
[Swift](http://swift.org/)
programming language.

## What is an PostgreSQL extension?

The PostgreSQL database server is quite modular and can be extended with
custom SQL functions and custom SQL types.

Such extensions can be written in PSQL itself,
in scripting languages such as Python or TCL,
and in plain C.
